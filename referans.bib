abstract = {This paper describes and analyses the performance of a novel feature extraction technique for the recognition of segmented/cursive characters that may be used in the context of a segmentation-based handwritten word recognition system. The Modified Direction Feature (MDF) extraction technique builds upon the Direction Feature (DF) technique proposed previously that extracts direction information from the structure of character contours. This principal was extended so that the direction information is integrated with a technique for detecting transitions between background and foreground pixels in the character image. In order to improve on the DF extraction technique, a number of modifications were undertaken. With a view to describe the character contour more effectively, a re-design of the direction number determination technique was performed. Also, an additional global feature was introduced to improve the recognition accuracy for those characters that were most frequently confused with patterns of similar appearance. MDF was tested using a neural network-based classifier and compared to the DF and Transition Feature (TF) extraction techniques. MDF outperformed both DF and TF techniques using a benchmark dataset and compared favourably with the top results in the literature. A recognition accuracy of above 89\% is reported on characters from the CEDAR dataset.},

It is a simplified version of the more general problem of dynamic collision detection between two general shaped rigid bodies in the space. Two algorithms are proposed. The first presented approach is based on the exact value of the distance between two cylinders, the second is based on a new theorem which allows to estimate the exact distance for a given maximum desired error. In some circumstances, the second approach can be preferred because faster.},

abstract = {One of the key tasks in computer vision is the identification and matching of coherent shapes in different images. In signature verification these shapes are represented by the strokes of the signature. Strokes may fall apart, close up, change or simply disappear among different signatures of the same signer. This paper proposes an algorithm to tackle the stroke matching problem using an area based method for finding and linking corresponding strokes and dynamic time warping to perform intra stroke matching. Using the above method the two dimensional image comparison problem can be reduced to a one dimensional case. The method was tested on the corpus of the 2004 Signature Verification Competition; experimental results are presented and evaluated. A generalized form of the algorithm could well be applied on other areas of computer vision.},

The recognition of Chinese characters is different from western handwriting recognition and poses a special challenge. To provide an overview of the technical status and inspire future research, this paper reviews the advances in online Chinese character recognition (OLCCR), with emphasis on the research works from the 1990s. Compared to the research in the 1980s, the research efforts in the 1990s aimed to further relax the constraints of handwriting, namely, the adherence to standard stroke orders and stroke numbers and the restriction of recognition to isolated characters only. The target of recognition has shifted from regular script to fluent script in order to better meet the requirements of practical applications. The research works are reviewed in terms of pattern representation, character classification, learning/adaptation, and contextual processing. We compare important results and discuss possible directions of future research.},

@article{Szeliski2010,
abstract = {As humans, we perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world around us with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem, and what is the current state of the art?Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging and fun consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos.More than just a source of "recipes", this text/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting this process to produce the best possible descriptions of a scene. Exercises are presented throughout the book, with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms.Suitable for either an undergraduate or a graduate-level course in computer vision, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries.Dr. Richard Szeliski has over twenty years' experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft.},
